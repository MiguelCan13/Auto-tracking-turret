TAAMUHCAK 2025

---------------

This year we challenged ourselves and contructed a automated turret meant to extinguish fires.

I learned image processing using opencv, how to use hardware component such as servo motors, joysticks, and arduino.

Most importantly, we were able to produce a accurate tracking system using our laptops camera.

The hardware used was one arduino uno, and 2 servo motors, thats it!

It tracks anything orange at the moment, with special focus on pingpong balls(this is what it prioritizes)
